// /*This lecture titled "Operations in JavaScript" introduces fundamental operations in JavaScript, focusing on variables, arithmetic operations, and logical operations. Here are the key points:

// Basic Arithmetic Operations: Covers addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, providing examples using variables.

// Increment and Decrement: Introduces increment (++) and decrement (--) shorthand notation for adjusting variable values.

// Comparison Operations: Discusses comparison operators like equality (==), inequality (!=), greater than (>), and less than (<), all returning boolean values.

// Logical Operations: Explains logical operators such as AND (&&) and OR (||), useful for evaluating multiple conditions in statements.

// Assignment Operations: Introduces shorthand assignment operators like += and -=, facilitating easier updates to variable values.

// Operator Precedence: Emphasizes the importance of operator precedence and recommends using parentheses for clarity in complex expressions.

// The lecture concludes with encouragement to practice these operations and the importance of writing clear, maintainable code.*/
